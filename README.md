# Flock – Baby Shower Edition

**Special Edition:**  
This standalone version of **Flock** was created specifically for our baby shower — a space for friends and family to share prayers for our daughter **Elia** before she’s even born. You can leave a prayer through **voice or text**, and join us in covering her life in prayer from the very beginning.

**Note:** This is a one-off, forked version of the main Flock app and will not receive ongoing updates. It's here for showcase purposes and to celebrate this meaningful moment in our lives.

## Mission

## Key Features

- Leave a prayer for Elia via **voice recording** or **typed message**.
- View all prayers shared by others.
